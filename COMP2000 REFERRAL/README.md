This is my Comp2000 Referral Submission

The default user login details are Username: "User" Password: "123"

The submitted code contains a fully functioning app that allows a User to create an account and then login with that given account. 
The user can then enter a navigatable home page where they can log out, manage their preferences and adjust their details. 
For demonstrative purposes the only preference is the toggling of notifications. The user is able to view their information, then update it or even delete their account.

The development of the app was hindered as the work was tasked with the expectation of being connected to an API for external data storage. 
However, this API was not available for submission and hence the functionality of the App has been altered to allow local accounts to exist.
I cannot confirm whether the app actually works with the API as I was never able to test with it.
